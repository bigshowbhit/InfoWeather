The WeatherInfo App is an Android application designed for real-time weather updates. It integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, allowing users to view current temperature, timezone, and other weather details for selected cities. Key features include an intuitive UI built with Jetpack Compose, city selection with a persistent list, priority-based weather details, and refresh functionality for live updates. The app ensures smooth performance with Hilt for dependency injection and Retrofit for API communication, making weather monitoring efficient and user-friendly.
