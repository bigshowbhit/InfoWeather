Key features include an intuitive UI built with Jetpack Compose, city selection with a persistent list, priority-based weather details, and refresh functionality for live updates. The app ensures smooth performance with Hilt for dependency injection and Retrofit for API communication, making weather monitoring efficient and user-friendly.
